## Behind the scenes

- Converts the maze image into a binary grid (white = open, black = wall)
- Runs Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path
- Draws the resulting route directly on `<canvas>`

## From demo to real work

This toy demo uses BFS to explore a grid - the same principle behind routing delivery trucks, optimizing task scheduling in compute pipelines, and building recommendation graph traversals at scale.

Curious how this toy demo connects to real-world problems?
