## Behind the scenes

- Converts to binary grid (white=open, black=wall).
- Runs BFS to compute the shortest path.
- Draws the solution on `<canvas>`.

## From demo to real work

This demo uses breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path in a grid. The same principle applies to:

- Routing delivery trucks through constrained road networks
- Optimizing task scheduling in compute pipelines
- Building recommendation graph traversals at scale
