  "summary": "I help teams make Python and ML code run faster and more efficiently. Typical results include shorter processing times, higher throughput, and smoother ML deployments. I co-founded and scaled a video translation platform to 60 k+ users on GCP/Kubernetes, focusing on runtime performance, async parallelism, and model-serving optimization. My expertise lies in profiling, GPU/CPU efficiency, and designing pipelines that stay responsive under load.",
